16 years ago we started on the journey of creating this product with a five year goal of becoming
the standard C2 solution for the aerospace industry.  It's taken a bit longer than that, but COSMOS
has gone from supporting a single program at a single company, to supporting hundreds of programs
at hundreds of companies around the world. It has been a great experience.

As of today, July 16th, 2022, the two creators of COSMOS are no longer employed by Ball and have moved on
to create a new company.

Thanks to all of the COSMOS users everywhere, and we look forward to continuing to work with you in
the future.

Ryan Melton and Jason Thomas
