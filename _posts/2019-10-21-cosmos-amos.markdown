Ryan recently attended the Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies Conference ([AMOS](https://amostech.com/)) in September. He was selected for a poster presentation based on the paper entitled ["An open source long term archiving and trending solution for SSA"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2017_AMOS_Paper.pdf). It was based on the COSMOS [DART]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/v4/dart-overview/) tool which supports long term storage and trending of command and telemetry data. If you look at the official [AMOS Summary]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/RPT_2019_AMOS_SUMMARY.pdf) you might also spot him (hint: Thursday)!

Jason atteneded the conference back in 2017 and was able to present a talk about COSMOS based on another paper entitled ["A Cloud-based, Open-Source, Command-and-Control Software Paradigm for Space Situational Awareness (SSA)"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2017_AMOS_Paper.pdf).
