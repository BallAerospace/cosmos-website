## SSL-TLS 

With moving cosmos to container based service, we do not support ssl/tls out of the box you need to set this part up. So here is some information on enabling SSL and TLS. If you want to read more you can go to the Traefik [docs](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/entrypoints/#tls)

### Generate the certificate

> Self-signed certificates are considered insecure for the Internet. Firefox will treat the site as having an invalid certificate, while Chrome will act as if the connection was plain HTTP. Openssl command 

To create a new Self-Signed SSL Certificate, use the openssl req command:

```sh
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 \
            -x509 \
            -sha256 \
            -days 3650 \
            -nodes \
            -out example.crt \
            -keyout example.key
```
Letâ€™s breakdown the command and understand what each option means:

- `newkey rsa:4096` - Creates a new certificate request and 4096 bit RSA key. The default one is 2048 bits.
- `x509` - Creates a X.509 Certificate.
- `sha256` - Use 265-bit SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm).
- `days 3650` - The number of days to certify the certificate for. 3650 is ten years. You can use any positive integer.
- `nodes` - Creates a key without a passphrase.
- `out example.crt` - Specifies the filename to write the newly created certificate to. You can specify any file name.
- `keyout example.key` - Specifies the filename to write the newly created private key to. You can specify any file name.

For more information about the `openssl req` command options, visit the [OpenSSL req documentation page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/openssl-req.html).

> Note this command is being run from a linux  machine and from inside of the root cosmos directory.

```sh
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 \
            -x509 \
            -sha256 \
            -days 3650 \
            -nodes \
            -out example.crt \
            -keyout ./cosmos-traefik/cert.key
            -out ./cosmos-traefik/cert.crt

Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:.
State or Province Name (full name) []:.
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:.
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:.
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:.
Common Name (eg, your name or your server hostname) []: <!-- UPDATE WITH YOUR HOSTNAME HERE -->
Email Address []:
```

### Updating the cosmos-traefik Dockerfile

> We need to add the cert to the docker container.

### Update docker-compose.yaml

> We want to update treafik to also use 443, so open the `compose.yaml` file and update the `cosmos-traefik` ports to `443:443`

```diff

Now you can run `./cosmos-control.sh start` and it should work....

## Let's Encrypt (with manual challenge).

#### KEY

privkey.pem is the "key" file

Sometimes it is improperly named as cert.key or example.com.key.

#### CRT

fullchain.pem is your "crt" file.

Sometimes it is improperly named as example.com.crt.

#### CRT/KEY Bundle

bundle.pem would be made like so: cat fullchain.pem privkey.pem > bundle.pem

HAProxy is the only server that I know of that uses bundle.pem.

#### cert.pem

cert.pem contains ONLY your certificate, which can only be used by itself if the browser already has the certificate which signed it, which may work in testing (which makes it seem like it may be the right file), but will actually fail for many of your users in production with a security error of untrusted certificate.

However, you don't generally use the cert.pem by itself. It's almost always coupled with chain.pem as fullchain.pem.

#### chain.pem

chain.pem is the intermediary signed authority, signed by the root authority - which is what all browsers are guaranteed to have in their pre-built cache.

### Checking certs

You can inspect the cert only like so:

```
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout
```

## TLS1.3 vs TLS1.2

Some firewalls have issues with how new 1.3 is so in traefik you can update the TLS options to support 1.2.

```
tls:
  options:
    default:
      minVersion: VersionTLS12
    mintls13:
      minVersion: VersionTLS13
```
