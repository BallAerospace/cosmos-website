This document provides the information necessary to write test procedures using the COSMOS scripting API. Scripting in COSMOS is designed to be simple and intuitive. The code completion ability for command and telemetry mnemonics makes Script Runner the ideal place to write your procedures, however any text editor will do. If there is functionality that you don't see here or perhaps an easier syntax for doing something, please submit a ticket.
