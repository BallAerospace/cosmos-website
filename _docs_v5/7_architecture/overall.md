COSMOS is what has traditionally been known as a Command and Control system (C2) and more modernly called a Command, Control, and Communication system (C3). But what does that mean? And what can it be used for?

COSMOS was born in the aerospace industry and used as the user interface for the testing of satellites and satellite components. It then moved onto testing other pieces of aerospace hardware, and eventually to operating satellites on-orbit. Today it has evolved into a general purpose communication platform that can be used for any industry and application where data logging, data display, and a common user interface are valuable. This ranges to applications in home automation, Internet-Of-Things (IOT), production line automation, robotics, industrial test, and many more.

One way to think of COSMOS is as a hub that fans out to connect to set of other systems (referred to as targets), and brings all of their data and user interfaces together in one place. This is a powerful concept. With everything in one place, you can bring together disparate systems to act as a unified whole.
