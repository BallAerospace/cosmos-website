Welcome to the COSMOS Enterprise Edition. The Enterprise Edition of COSMOS takes the Open Source Edition and adds a bunch of great features critical for mission operations. These include individual user accounts, Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Kubernetes support, end-to-end encryption, and more! It also allows the licenser to modify and extend COSMOS without publishing their changes.
