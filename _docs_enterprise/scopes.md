Scopes can be thought of as a fully contained COSMOS installation. Any gems or plugins (and thus targets, interfaces, etc) installed to a scope are local to that scope. That means you can create multiple scopes for different test setups, programs, etc without complexifying or corrupting an existing COSMOS setup.
